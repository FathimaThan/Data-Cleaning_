# Data Cleaning Project
This repository contains a project on data cleaning using Python. It includes scripts and documentation for handling missing values, removing and merging duplicate rows, and validating and formatting 'Name', 'Email', 'Join Date', 'Department', and 'Salary' fields to prepare the `messy_Data.csv` dataset for analysis.
## Files
* `cleaned_dataset.csv`: This file contains the cleaned version of the dataset after applying data cleaning operations.
* `Assignment.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook file that includes Python code used for data cleaning, along with explanations and comments.
* `Assignment_Updated.ipynb`: Updated Jupyter Notebook with modifications â€” used department-wise average to impute the salary column instead of the total mean and removed invalid email IDs instead of using placeholder values.
* `Summary Document`.pdf: Details the data cleaning process, including methodologies, assumptions, and challenges encountered and resolved.
* `Summary Document_Updated.pdf`: Updated summary document with revisions and additional information.
